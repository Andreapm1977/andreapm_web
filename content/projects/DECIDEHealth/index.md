##### Description

The project aims to develop tools for effective decision-making regarding prevention, healthcare provision, social care in the Czech Republic, and delivery of interventions addressing lifestyle diseases. The project is based on methods and findings from social sciences. Key elements are adapting the Future Elderly Model (FEM) for the Czech context and establishing a modular eHealth system. The first objective is to enhance the predictive potential of the FEM by integrating machine learning elements and expanding the model to include the analysis of administrative data and neurodegenerative diseases. The second objective involves creating and validating an eHealth system and programs to support the health status of diverse populations while collecting relevant health and behavioral data.

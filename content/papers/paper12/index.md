##### Abstract

In this paper we simulate BMI lifetime profile costs based on longitudinal electronic clinical data on a large representative sample of the Italian population. In particular, we simulate how patients belonging to different BMI classes (normo-weight, overweight, and obese (I, II, and III)) generate different lifetime cost profiles within the primary care setting. Our findings show that compared to normo-weight patients, the obese generate the largest cost differential over the entire life cycle, while the overweight spends less than the normo-weight, mainly because of savings generated starting from early middle age onward. According to the OECD projections, a steady increase in obesity rates is estimated until at least 2030, with a significant economic impact. Our estimate could represent an important reference for policymakers to prioritize public interventions against the obesity pandemic.
